#Habbash - هبّاش

**Habbash** is a culturally inspired mobile quiz game designed for Saudi and Arab youth.  
It offers a sarcastic, tricky, and humorous gameplay experience in Arabic, drawing inspiration from *The Impossible Quiz*, but fully localized to reflect Saudi humor and language.

##About the App

Habbash is not just a game — it’s a personality. Players are guided by the hilarious character **Habbash**, who challenges them with unexpected, tricky, and comically absurd questions that test their logic, wit, and attention to detail.

Designed with love for Saudi culture, the game features:
- Localized humor and sarcastic commentary.
- Original characters and art assets.
- Interactive challenges with unpredictable twists.
- Full Arabic support — both text and context.

##Why Habbash?

Research showed:
- 60% of users struggle with non-Arabic games.
- 40.2% said the challenge and thinking is what keeps them playing.
- 31.8% play for laughs and funny moments.
- 28% are driven by curiosity about the next question.

This inspired us to build something funny, weird, and relatable — just like *The Impossible Quiz*, but in our language and culture.
